# Skellam-Edge-Detector
Background Subtraction and Edge Detection using Skellam Distribution
## Description
Here, we show the usage of Skellam Distribution for Edge Detection in Spatial Domain and Background Subtraction in Temporal Domain. For dataset, we take natural images and videos and also generate images and videos synthetically. We analyse the results of Edge Detection by comparing it with [Canny Edge Detector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) and Background Subtraction manually.
